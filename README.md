# Planck_sun_spectrum_fit
Simple program showing how to fit the irradiance spectrum of the Sun given some experimental data using Planck's law of radiation.
Experimental data shown in this repository has been extracted from https://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/ (from TSIS-1 Solar Spectral Irradiance - Twelve Hour Average, at a single time 2022-12-05T00:00:00)
